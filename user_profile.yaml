      Health Coverage Report
      Version {version}, Generated on {date}

      This chart shows the population-weighted averages of key health indicators
      categorized by status (On-track or Off-track).
    suffix_text: |
      Population weighting was based on projected births for 2022.
      While most countries had indicator data for 2022, some countries only have indicator data
      from earlier years, depending on the date of the latest data collection exercise.

      The analysis demonstrates that On-track countries have significantly
      higher coverage of ANC4 and SAB indicators.
